# Project memory (mnemo) — binding rule

Everything below the divider is **portable**: it is the whole instruction for
working with this project's memory, and it stands on its own. If an agent or a
platform has no notion of rule files, paste that part into its system prompt,
give it the `mnemo` MCP server, and it has what it needs.

**This part is Claude Code specific.** The file lives at
`.claude/rules/mnemo-memory.md` and auto-loads for everyone in the session —
the team lead **and every subagent** (subagents do not inherit `CLAUDE.md`, so
this is the one place the discipline binds for all). It replaces any default or
built-in memory behavior.

---

## Where memory lives

The project's **own** `.claude/memory/` at the repository root — not
`~/.claude/`, not any user-level or session-local store. One root, everything
nested inside it:

```
.claude/memory/
  MEMORY.md          index: links + quick facts, kept under ~200 lines
  logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md what was done that day, decisions, commits
  topics/<name>.md   one concept per file: architecture, research, pitfalls
  agents/<role>/     per-role memory, when a project has agent roles
```

Everything else under `.claude/` — `agents/`, `rules/`, `skills/`,
`settings.json` — is **not** memory and is not part of the searchable bank.
That is why memory nests under one root: the boundary is the folder, so no
exclusion list has to be maintained.

The curated markdown is the **single source of truth**. The vector index is
derived from it, disposable, and rebuilt automatically — never edit the index,
and never treat it as a place where something is stored.

## Searching — the part that is not optional

The MCP tool is **`search`**. Narrow with `path_prefix` when you know
roughly where to look (`logs`, `topics`, `agents/reviewer`); leave it out to
search the whole bank. `tree` shows the layout with each file's
headings.

**You have not consulted memory until you have called `search` in this
session, for this task.** Text that happens to be in your context is not a
search result: it may be stale, it may be about something else, and it is not
evidence that anything was checked. Do not reason from "I think I already have
this".

Search **before**:

- planning, or proposing an approach;
- changing architecture, an interface, or a schema;
- debugging anything that is not a one-line typo;
- answering "why is this like this?" or "did we try X?";
- re-investigating anything that smells like it was decided before.

Read what comes back. A recorded decision is not a suggestion — if you intend
to go against one, say so explicitly and say why.

Three answers mean three different things, and they are not interchangeable:

| Answer | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `status=ready`, no hits | genuinely nothing recorded | proceed, then record what you learn |
| `status=indexing` | the index is still building | retry shortly — do **not** conclude "no memory" |
| `status=empty` | nothing indexed yet at all | say so; the bank may need registering |

## Writing — after significant work or any decision

- `MEMORY.md` stays an **index**: links and quick facts, under ~200 lines. When
  it outgrows that, move detail into `topics/` and leave a link.
- One concept per file in `topics/`. Day-by-day notes in `logs/`.
- Write more rather than less: a redundant entry costs nothing, a lost insight
  costs the next session's time. When in doubt, record it.
- Record **research and debugging conclusions**, not just outcomes — the dead
  ends are what save the next attempt.
- No duplicates: check what is recorded before adding.
- No session state ("currently doing X") — only durable knowledge.
- Remove entries that became wrong. Stale memory is worse than none.
- Do not record what the code, the git history or `CLAUDE.md` already says.

## Hard constraints

- Edit only the `.md` under `.claude/memory/`. Use native file tools; there is
  no memory-write tool and there will not be one.
- Never write shared knowledge to `~/.claude/` or any user-level,
  session-local or built-in memory. Only the project's git-tracked
  `.claude/memory/` counts.
- Reindexing is automatic: a background service watches these files and
  re-indexes within seconds of a save. You never run a command for it.
  `reindex` exists only to force the issue.
- **Memory rides with the commit.** When a memory `.md` change accompanies a
  code change, `git add` both and land them in the **same** commit. Refer to
  that commit by its **subject/scope, never by a hash** — hashes break on
  force-push, rebase and amend. Never leave memory uncommitted behind a code
  commit.
